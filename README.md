Crafting Recipe fullfilment arbitrage calculator.

Turn a profit by buying materials off the Auction House
and re-selling them as a crafted item.

The sum of materials (+AH listing cut) must be less than the sale price of the finished item.

The user selects crafted items to monitor on the AH.
When the sum cost of the reagents required to craft the item is
less than the sale cost of the item on the AH, the item
is highlighted as profitable.

The application is aware of crafting materials listed at different prices,
and can tell you how many of each item can be crafted at a profit.
